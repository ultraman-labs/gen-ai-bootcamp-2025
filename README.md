# gen-ai-bootcamp-2025
A structured learning path to understand, build, and deploy Generative AI. Covers AI assistants, cloud AI, model training, and production deployment across four levels (Beginner to Expert). Learn real-world AI applications, best practices, and optimization techniques.

# GenAI Bootcamp

## ðŸ“Œ Bootcamp Goal
This bootcamp is designed to **demystify Generative AI (GenAI)** by providing clear, structured learning paths. With the increasing hype around GenAIâ€”driven by venture capital investmentâ€”many professionals face **confusion and mismatched expectations**. Our goal is to equip developers, decision-makers, and executives with the **technical and business clarity** needed to navigate and build **real-world GenAI solutions**.

## ðŸš€ The Problem
The applications and benefits of GenAI have been **overhyped**, leading to **technical and business uncertainty** for:
- Developers (Devs)
- Directors of Engineering (DOEs)
- Vice Presidents (VPs)

This bootcamp will bridge the gap between **expectation and reality** by providing a **hands-on, structured approach** to learning.

## ðŸŽ¯ Target Audience
This bootcamp is open to **all levels** of experience within the tech industry, helping participants:
- **Understand the landscape and boundaries** of GenAI.
- **Develop critical thinking and troubleshooting skills** for GenAI workloads.
- **Build practical AI applications**, from prototypes to production.

## ðŸ“š Learning Levels
The bootcamp follows a **Maturity Model approach**, structured into four levels:

### **Level 100 â€” Beginner**
ðŸ”¹ AI-powered Assistants & Prompt Engineering  

### **Level 200 â€” Intermediate**
ðŸ”¹ AI as a Service & Cloud AI  
ðŸ”¹ Building agents locally with open-source models & Langchain  

### **Level 300 â€” Advanced**
ðŸ”¹ Model Training, Optimization, & Quantization  

### **Level 400 â€” Enterprise / Expert**
ðŸ”¹ Deploying AI models for production  
ðŸ”¹ Rightsizing for Compute (AI Accelerators)
