# ChatGPT: Prompt Findings

Using the Chat GPT-4o and upon entering the "Language Prompt" (link below), the response was the following.  

NOTE: I call my OpenAI ChatGPT "Vato" which is Spanish slang for "Dude"
#### Got it, Vato! You want to practice translating English to Spanish interactively, following a structured method where I guide you with hints, a small vocabulary table, and sentence structure— without giving away direct answers.

```c
GPT 4o provided the requested vocabulary table, an English sentence to be translated into Spanish, the sentence structure and a hint. And it was clear to me that I was being given a sentence to translate, because the LLM GPT 4o said: 
```

#### Let's start with a sentence. Try translating this:

**"The dog is sleeping under the tree."**

### **Vocabulary Table**

|Spanish|English|
|---|---|
|perro|dog|
|dormir|to sleep|
|debajo|under|
|árbol|tree|

### **Sentence Framework**

[Subject] [Verb] [Preposition] [Object].

### **Hint**

- **Remember**: "To sleep" needs to be conjugated correctly for "the dog" (third-person singular).
- **Prepositions** often follow the structure "under + the + noun."

Give it a shot! I'll review your translation and guide you from there.
