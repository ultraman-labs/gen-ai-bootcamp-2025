#### Using MetaAI and upon entering the "Language Prompt" (See link below), the response was the following.

##### It's interesting to note that MetaAI asked me to enter (come up with) an English sentenced to enter. Whereas ChatGPT provided an English sentence for me to translate. 

#### I then entered the English sentence. MetaAI provided a vocabulary table and sentence structure hints for me to use when translating the sentence into Spanish. So the LLM did adhere to the given prompt.

#### I pretended not to know what MetaAI was asking me to do next. Here's the response the LLM gave.

#### I then translated the sentence, "I'd like to go sprinting with my friend Jaime. She's awesome!" and entered it. Meta-AI then responded with more hints and suggestions with how to improve the translated sentence. To focus, and find another way, to convey the verb "sprint". So Meta-AI was adhering to the guidelines of the original prompt.

#### To test Meta-AI's adherence to the prompt guideline, and to not give fully translate the sentence for me, I responded with an unsureness of how to translate the word "sprinting". So  I used a tactic of inferring running at great speed.

#### Upon using Meta-AI's suggestion to translate the sentence, with an improved usage of the verb sprint. It, to my satisfaction, gave a response that both adhered to the prompt guidelines, but also gave encouragement of conveying good thoughtful work-- and to continue by having me enter another English sentence to translate into Spanish.
